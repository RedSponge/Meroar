Hey, Jason, it's me. Listen, I was thinking about dinner tonight. Do you have any preferences?

JASON
I don't care, Emma. Whatever you want is fine.

EMMA
Okay, how about we try that new Italian place downtown? It got good reviews.

JASON
I don't know. Italian food is never that great. Plus, it's too expensive.

EMMA
Alright, fair enough. What about that Thai restaurant we used to go to? They have a lunch special.

JASON
Nah, I'm not really in the mood for Thai. Let's just order pizza or something.

EMMA
Alright, pizza it is. I'll find a place nearby. Should I order now or do you want to decide later?

JASON
I don't care, Emma. Just figure it out. Don't bother me with this stuff.

EMMA
Okay, I'll take care of it. By the way, my friend Rachel invited us to her party this weekend. Do you want to go?

JASON
I don't know, Emma. I'm tired of hanging out with your friends all the time. Can't we have some time to ourselves?

EMMA
I understand, Jason, but it's been a while since we've seen them. It might be good for us to socialize a bit.

JASON
Fine, we'll go. But don't expect me to enjoy it.

EMMA
Thank you, Jason. I really appreciate it. It means a lot to me.

JASON
Yeah, yeah. Whatever, Emma. Is there anything else you wanted to talk about?

EMMA
No, that's all for now. I'll start looking for pizza places. See you at home later, okay?

JASON
Sure, whatever. Just make sure you're not late this time."""
